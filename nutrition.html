                <h2>Nutrition And Diet</h2>

                <p>Eating a well-balanced diet can help you get the calories and nutrients you 
                    need to fuel your daily activities, including regular exercise.

                    When it comes to eating foods to fuel your exercise performance, 
                    it’s not as simple as choosing vegetables over doughnuts. You need to eat 
                    the right types of food at the right times of the day.
                    
                    Learn about the importance of healthy breakfasts, workout snacks, and meal 
                    plans.

                    <p>After your workout, your body tries to rebuild its glycogen stores and repair and regrow those muscle proteins.

                        Eating the right nutrients soon after you exercise can help your body get this done faster. It is particularly important to eat carbs and protein after your workout.
                        <br>
                        Doing this helps your body: <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Decrease muscle protein breakdown.</li>
                            <li>Increase muscle protein synthesis (growth).</li>
                            <li>Restore glycogen stores.</li>
                            <li>Enhance recovery.</li>
                        </ul>

                    alt="pre-work out meal image">

                    <p>
                        It's recommended to consume a full meal 2–3 hours before your workout. For meals eaten closer to your workout, choose simpler carbs and some protein.
                        <br>
                        A combination of carbs and protein is recommended for pre-workout meals. Fat can also be beneficial, but it should be consumed at least two hours before exercise.
                        <br>
                        recommended meals include: <br>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Sandwich on whole-grain bread, lean protein and a side salad</li>
                            <li>Lean protein, brown rice and roasted vegetables</li>
                            <li>A cup of oatmeal topped with banana and sliced almonds</li>
                            <li>Whole-grain cereal and milk</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>
                        The primary goal of your post-workout meal is to supply your body with the right nutrients for adequate recovery and to maximize the benefits of your workout.

                        Choosing easily digested foods will promote faster nutrient absorption.
                        <br>
                        The following lists contain examples of simple and easily digested foods: <br>
